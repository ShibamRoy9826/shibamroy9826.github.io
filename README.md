# My Portfolio üíº

This repository contains my portfolio, its basically a static website hosted with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and made with vanilla HTML,CSS ,JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.
Its live [here](https://shibamroy9826.github.io/).
This contains information about my skills(including my experience with them), my projects, about myself, and my certifications.
I would highly recommend checking it out, but if you are feeling lazy, I have attached some screenshots below

## Screenshots üì∑

> [!NOTE]
> All pages aren't included in screenshots(Infact most of it isn't), because I have to prepare for exams... I will update it soon...

## Projects üõ†Ô∏è 

These are all the "proper" projects that I made, there are a few others too, but I would rather not like to showcase them now... They are pretty bad compared to these, I will update them here after I finish recreating them!
